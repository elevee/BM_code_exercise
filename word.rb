# Write two classes. One which will store a word and be able to tell me if the word is a palindrome or not. The other class will store a dictionary of words. I should be able to query the dictionary for a word and it will return the definition and whether or not the word is a palindrome.

# So I should be able to load the dictionary with

# tree: a plant having a permanently woody main stem or trunk,ordinarily growing to a considerable height, and usuallydeveloping branches at some distance from the ground
# house: a building in which people live; residence for human beings.
# racecar: racing car, is a palindrome
# nosirawayapapayawarison unknown definition, is a palindrome
