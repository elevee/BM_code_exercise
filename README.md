BM_code_exercise
================

A simple code exercise with the following criteria:

Write two classes. One which will store a word and be able to tell me if the word is a palindrome or not. The other class will store a dictionary of words. 

I should be able to query the dictionary for a word and it will return the definition and whether or not the word is a palindrome.

So I should be able to load the dictionary with:
